## 🏡 Airbnb Data Analysis & Visualization

### 📌 Project Overview
This project explores Airbnb listings data to uncover insights about pricing, availability, and customer preferences across different neighborhoods. Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, I analyzed key factors influencing Airbnb prices, neighborhood trends, and room types. The project includes interactive visualizations and data-driven insights that help understand Airbnb market dynamics.

### 🔍 Key Objectives
Analyze the distribution of prices and availability across different neighborhoods.
Visualize neighborhood-wise listing densities, price variations, and room-type distributions.
Identify top neighborhoods by average price, number of listings, and total reviews.
Create interactive Treemap and Sunburst charts to show hierarchical relationships in the data.

### 📂 Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/), which provides publicly available Airbnb listing data for various cities worldwide. The data includes details such as price, room type, availability, number of reviews, neighborhood information, and host details.

### 📊 Data & Methodology
Dataset: Airbnb listings dataset with features like price, room type, availability, reviews, and neighborhood details.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed outliers, and transformed categorical data where necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generated summary statistics, visualized trends, and performed feature analysis.
Visualization Tools: Used Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for static and interactive charts.

### 📌 Visualizations Included
✔ Scatter Plots: Price vs Availability, Neighborhood-wise Price Distribution
✔ Bar Charts: Top 10 Neighborhoods by Reviews, Room Type Distribution
✔ Treemap: Distribution of Listings by Neighborhood
✔ Sunburst Chart: Hierarchical view of Airbnb market trends
✔ Clustered Bar Charts: Neighborhood Group vs Room Type Price Trends

### 🚀 Technologies Used
Python 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy)
Data Visualization 📊 (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
Jupyter Notebook 💻 for interactive analysis

### 📢 Insights & Findings
The most expensive neighborhoods tend to have fewer listings but higher demand.
Private rooms are more affordable than entire apartments but are more frequent in certain neighborhoods.
Some neighborhoods have high availability but fewer bookings, indicating lower demand.
Interactive sunburst & treemap charts reveal deep insights into the pricing structure.

### 📌 Next Steps
🔹 Perform predictive analysis on Airbnb pricing trends.
🔹 Build a dashboard using Power BI or Tableau for better interactive exploration.
🔹 Apply clustering techniques (K-Means) to group similar listings.
